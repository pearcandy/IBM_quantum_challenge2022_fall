IBM Quantum Fall Challenge 2022
Nov 11 â€”Nov 8

The challenge will start with an introduction of Qiskit primitives and the programming model it describes, while drawing parallels to its interface with the Qiskit Runtime service and its features. This will proceed with the succeeding notebooks that will serve as a guide for constructing and building upon a few common quantum computational algorithms using this primitive construct. Each notebook slowly ramps up the complexity of the routines built and introduces features within Qiskit Primitives and the Qiskit Runtime service.

Each exercise is presented as a Jupyter notebook hosted on the IBM Quantum Lab site. Complete all parts in each lab and pass the graders to complete the exercise. The exercises are divided into categories of Foundational, Intermediate and Advanced based on the complexity they entail.

To recognize your achievement for completing the exercises, you will receive a credly acclaimed digital achievement badge to showcase the skills you have developed during the challenge! Badges are up for partial and full completion of the exercises!
